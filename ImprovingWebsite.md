User Groups & Community Events on Improving.com
Overview (from the Community page)
The User Groups & Community Support section states:

"We open our office spaces up to local groups on weeknights to enable continuous learning and foster relationships within our communities. Learn from thought leaders and hold discussions with like-minded peers about topics that interest you."

They invite visitors to check individual location pages for groups in each community, and encourage people to contact them if they want to start a new group or get Improving's support for an existing one.

Current Status Across All Locations
I checked every location page, and all of them currently show "Sorry! No User Groups Scheduled":

Dallas, TX (HQ) — No User Groups Scheduled
Atlanta, GA — No User Groups Scheduled
Austin, TX — No User Groups Scheduled
Chicago, IL — No User Groups Scheduled
Cleveland, OH — No User Groups Scheduled
Columbus, OH — No User Groups Scheduled
Houston, TX — No User Groups Scheduled
Minneapolis, MN — No User Groups Scheduled
Omaha, NE — No User Groups Scheduled
Calgary, AB — No User Groups Scheduled
Each location page has a dedicated section/placeholder for User Group events, suggesting the infrastructure exists to list them when they're active — but none are currently scheduled as of today.

Related Active Community Events
While User Groups are dormant, Improving does have other active public community offerings:

Improving Talks — Weekly webinars every Wednesday at 12 PM CDT. Upcoming sessions include:
"AI That Works as a Team" (Feb 18, 2026)
"Governance That Actually Works" (Feb 25, 2026)
Past talks are archived on their YouTube channel
CodeLaunch — Their equity-free startup accelerator, currently accepting applications for 2026
Training & Coaching — Scrum.org partner offering certification courses, technical training, and AI workshops (30,000+ professionals trained globally)

Key Takeaway
The User Group program appears to be an established part of Improving's community model — they host local tech groups at their offices on weeknights — but no groups are currently listed on any of their 10+ location pages. If you're interested in starting or finding a group, they direct you to contact them.
