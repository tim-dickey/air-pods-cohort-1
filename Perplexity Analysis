***Perplexity Analysis***
**Prompt**
We have a challenge at Improving (www.improving.com). 
We advertise by a hashtag #lifeatimproving what is happening or has happened during the week. We host user groups (meetups) throughout the week and they are coordinated by different people outside of improving. We have a weekly webinar, "Improving Talks". As well, we speak at conferences. Each office hosts a community "movie night" where we invite family, friends, former colleagues, partners, and just about everyone else. We host CodeLaunch (www.codelaunch.com) as a startup competition that helps us lean into Conscious Capitalism. As well, we support the local chapters of Conscious Capitalism in the cities
that we operate.

With that context, we would like to build out software that helps us broadcast "Life at Improving". We're going to use the BMAD method to help develop this system.

**Perplexity Response**
Love this challenge; this is exactly the kind of thing your “actor playing a dev” persona was born to ship.

Here’s how I’d suggest we start with BMAD: define the *product slice* we’re building first, then we can drop into PRD/architecture mode next round.

## 1. Clarify the product vision

Proposed one-sentence vision:

> “Life at Improving is a storytelling platform that automatically gathers, curates, and publishes community moments—user groups, Improving Talks, conferences, movie nights, CodeLaunch, and Conscious Capitalism events—into a continuous #LifeAtImproving narrative across web, email, and social channels.” [improving](https://www.improving.com/conscious-capitalism/)

Key outcomes:

- Marketing and local coordinators spend less time chasing details and more time telling stories. [consciouscapitalism](https://www.consciouscapitalism.org/story/conscious-way-improving)
- Community members can easily see what’s happening this week and what they missed last week. [improving](https://www.improving.com/company/about/)
- The system makes Conscious Capitalism and CodeLaunch visibly central to Improving’s story, not side notes. [codelaunch](https://codelaunch.com)

If this feels “mostly right,” we’ll formalize it into a BMAD-style Product Brief next.

## 2. Define core user roles (v1)

Let’s start small and real:

- **Marketing storyteller** – owns #lifeatimproving content calendar, social posts, and blog/Web stories. [improving](https://www.improving.com/thoughts/culture-over-code-why-conscious-companies-will-thrive-in-the-age-of-ai/)
- **Office community lead** – runs local movie nights, user groups, and meetups.  
- **Event owner** – Improving Talks host, CodeLaunch organizers, conference speakers. [improving](https://www.improving.com/thoughts/from-the-floor-to-the-finale-my-codelaunch-experience/)
- **Community participant** – employees, family, partners, startup founders seeing and sharing content. [consciouscapitalism](https://www.consciouscapitalism.org/businesses/improving)

Next step in BMAD terms: we’ll write 1–2 top user journeys per role for the first release.

## 3. Scope v1 feature set

Instead of “all the things,” here’s a *thin slice* that still feels magical.

### a) Event intake & catalog

- Central event model: title, type (user group, Improving Talk, movie night, CodeLaunch, Conscious Capitalism, conference), office, date/time, tags. [improving](https://www.improving.com/conscious-capitalism/)
- Simple intake forms per event type (or integration with existing tools if you’re already using Meetup/Eventbrite).  
- Status: planned, live, completed, with basic owner/contact info.  

### b) Story capture workflow

For each event:

- Pre-event: quick “promo card” with date, description, link, and tags, ready to drop into social and internal comms. [improving](https://www.improving.com)
- Post-event: lightweight story template:
  - 3–5 highlights (what happened, who spoke, what we learned). [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr3VoixPVaE)
  - 1–3 quotes (speaker, participant, organizer). [improving](https://www.improving.com/thoughts/from-the-floor-to-the-finale-my-codelaunch-experience/)
  - 3–5 photos or media links.  
- Optionally let coordinators mark stories with Conscious Capitalism themes (higher purpose, stakeholder integration, etc.). [improving](https://www.improving.com/company/about/)

### c) #lifeatimproving content hub

- Internal “This Week at Improving” view:  
  - Card-based feed grouped by week, across all cities.  
  - Filters: office, event type, Conscious Capitalism, CodeLaunch, Improving Talks. [codelaunch](https://codelaunch.com)
- “Public-ready” toggle per event/story so marketing can see what’s cleared for external use.  

### d) Social & web publishing helpers

For each story, auto-generate:

- Suggested #lifeatimproving social post text variants (LinkedIn, X, Instagram), with correct tags (e.g., #CodeLaunch, #ConsciousCapitalism). [consciouscapitalism](https://www.consciouscapitalism.org/businesses/improving)
- A small set of prebuilt layouts for:  
  - Weekly newsletter section (“Life at Improving This Week”).  
  - Website “Life at Improving” page feed. [improving](https://www.improving.com)

We don’t have to automate *posting* in v1; it’s enough to make it one-click to copy/paste.

## 4. How this ties to Conscious Capitalism & CodeLaunch

You called out Conscious Capitalism and CodeLaunch as identity-defining, so let’s bake that in:

- Event “purpose tags” aligned to the four Conscious Capitalism pillars (Higher Purpose, Stakeholder Orientation, Conscious Leadership, Conscious Culture). [consciouscapitalism](https://www.consciouscapitalism.org/story/conscious-way-improving)
- Special treatment for CodeLaunch events in the UI: badges, timeline of finalists, and links to outcome stories (fundraising, follow-on milestones). [codelaunch](https://codelaunch.com/campaign/startup-grind/)
- Dashboards that can answer:  
  - “How many events per office reflect Conscious Capitalism pillars this quarter?” [improving](https://www.improving.com/conscious-capitalism/)
  - “How many CodeLaunch-related stories have we told this year?” [codelaunch](https://codelaunch.com/campaign/startup-grind/)

This keeps the product aligned with Improving’s “business as a force for good” narrative instead of just “calendar with marketing sauce.” [improving](https://www.improving.com/company/about/)

## 5. Next BMAD-aligned step

To stay true to the BMAD method’s spec-first spirit, next session I suggest we:

- Draft a **mini-PRD** for “Life at Improving v1” with 5–7 crisp requirements and 2–3 user stories per key role. [github](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/blob/main/docs/index.md)
- Sketch a lightweight architecture (probably a small web app + content API that can later integrate with your site and email tools). [bennycheung.github](https://bennycheung.github.io/bmad-reclaiming-control-in-ai-dev)

For now, one focused question to move us forward:

> Which of these feels like the *most valuable and realistic* first milestone for you:  
> 1) “Event intake + catalog only,”  
> 2) “Catalog + post-event story capture,” or  
> 3) “Catalog + stories + basic social copy generation”?

Pick one, and we’ll build the BMAD-style PRD around that slice next.
